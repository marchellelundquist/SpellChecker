# SpellChecker
Spell checker program written in Java for a class assignment.

This program takes in command-line arguments of a dictionary and a file that the user would like to have spell-checked.  By utilizing HashSets, regular expressions, and loads of string manipulation, the program outputs the misspelled words from the file passed in, alongside helpful suggestions for correctly-spelled words the user may have meant to have typed by removing and swapping letters in the misspelled words.
